Playing on Android can be fun. But every time I take a look at the Play Store, I feel spammed with titles
that just seem to rip you off. I am a casual gamer on mobile, and I am absolutely willing to pay a bit
for a decent game.

## The dark side

Unfortunately most games on mobile platforms now follow a model of giving you a "free" game, and then put
obstacles in your way, which you can pay out of your way. The classic *pay or wait* concept. But if you buy a
few *gems*, then you can take a shortcut. In the end, this all ruins the game mechanics IMHO.

Another way of monetizing games is ads. Ads are difficult. I absolutely understand the reason for monetizing
your app, your web-page, your creative work. With web pages, it is rather simple: I can put ads on my webpage,
and you can decide to use an add blocker. With apps it is a bit different. One concept is to annoy you with
the game mechanics (pay or wait), and make you watch ads to speed up things. Again, I think this completely
ruins a game. Or, you annoy me with ads, and offer me a way to buy myself out of the situation. Still, all
the add code is in the app, and nothing prevent the app creator from re-adding apps.

## The bright side

There are still game developers, who believe on a honest deal between the user and the creator. You create a
game that entertains me, and I am more than happy to pay for it.

The purpose of this web page is to curate a list of games, that follow this principle. Just to make it easier
for you to find game like this. And with a bit of luck, at some point, someone gives me a tip, that there is
another game like those that I didn't know yet. So it helps me as well.

## But wait …

… you feel like having a déjà vu? No, it isn't a glitch in the matrix: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/2ggaqp/i_had_made_a_site_called_honest_android_games_and/

In a nutshell, someone already create a page like this. Unfortunately that person decided to stop doing it. It was a great web page! I really miss it.

But since the idea of a curated list of media isn't that new, I wanted to re-create this page for a while now. Partly because sometimes you just have to do it if no one else does. Partly I think it makes a great hobby, and of course
because I wanted to play around with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), creating a
[static home page generator](https://github.com/ctron/hagen) which is up to the task.

And while working on this, I am still undecided how to name it. One the one side, naming it *Honest Android Games*
feels being a cheap rip off of the original page. On the other side, that is just what this is all about: Honest Android Games!
