## About

This is a real gem I missed in the first. Simply because browsing through the play store I didn't
understand at first what the game was about.

The setting is pretty clear, you are playing the role of Passepartout, the valet of Phileas Fogg. However, you are the one,
planning the journey around the world, one step at a time. The goal is clear, you must travel around the
world in 80 days.

During your voyage, you will read the story unfolding. Quite often you need to make a choice, by selecting the text which
lets the story continue. This will not only influence the current situation but might also unlock other events along
the line, depending on which route you take.

Not all routes are known to you, and you can learn more connection through items you pack, chats you have with other
travellers, or a few other ways.

## Is it for me?

It is a slow-paced game, which you can easily put away after a few minutes. And pick it up just as easily. The while
user interface and perfectly adapted for the mobile world.

The design of the game is great. But the absolutely awesome part of the app is the story. Around 150 locations you can visit,
in an interesting mix of 1870s time period and steampunk. You will need to do a lot of reading, that is what brings the
story to life, in your imagination.

I am not really fond of games, which require you to re-play the game over and over again to get some more out of it.
But 80 Days is different. Once I made it through once, there had been so many threads to follow up on. So many hidden
stories you discover, beyond 80 Days.

## Conclusion

It is an absolute gem that is definitely worth its money. The numerous locations, characters and hidden secrets in
the game offers you quite a universe to explore.
